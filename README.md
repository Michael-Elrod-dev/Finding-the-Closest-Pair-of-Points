# Finding-the-Closest-Pair-of-Points

Closest Pairs - 

For a deeper study of vectors, this program takes in one of the points.txt files, alist of two coordinates on a graph, and compares them to each other to find the pair of points that are closest together. The purpose of this program is to create a solution that runs for less than Î˜(n^2) time.
